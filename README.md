ERSMS is a web application which is being developed in the scope of CS319 course. This project allows Erasmus coordinators, students and the other stakeholders to achieve a smooth ERASMUS application process. This project aims to be a subsidiary app for the currently used [Erasmus+ Application System](https://app.erasmus.bilkent.edu.tr/) by removing the paper work done by the ERASMUS department coordinators.

# Technology Stack (Tentative)
.Net Core / C#, Angular, PostgreSQL, Docker, Redis...
